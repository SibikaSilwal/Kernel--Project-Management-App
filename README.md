# Kernel--Project-Management-App
Kernel is a project management Web Application. I built this web app because I was very fond of Basecamp (project management software) which is used at the place I intern. 
Therefore, inspired by its amazing features and cool looking UI, I tried to build something similar. Kernel includes most of the important features of Basecamp like: 
  organize projects, 
  manage team members, 
  designate tasks, 
  upload files, 
  discuss tasks on comment threads, 
  mark tasks as done, 
  add notes for projects, 
  update and delete the tasks, notes, etc.
